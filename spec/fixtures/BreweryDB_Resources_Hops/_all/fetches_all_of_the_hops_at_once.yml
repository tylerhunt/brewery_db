        Ideal for bittering and finishing any kind of English ales, and also works
        well in lagers due to its delicate, slightly spicy aroma.","countryOfOrigin":"GB","alphaAcidMin":4,"betaAcidMin":1.9,"betaAcidMax":2.8,"humuleneMin":38,"humuleneMax":45,"caryophylleneMin":12,"caryophylleneMax":16,"cohumuloneMin":28,"cohumuloneMax":32,"myrceneMin":25,"myrceneMax":25,"farneseneMin":0.4,"farneseneMax":0.4,"category":"hop","categoryDisplay":"Hops","createDate":"2013-06-24

        an English landrace, Fuggles were seedling selected in England in 1875. The
        true Fuggle (English) is sometimes considered a noble hop, and while it is
        sometimes considered inferior to Golding hop varieties such as the famous
        East Kent Goldings, Fuggle''s flavor and mild, spicy, woody aroma are deeply
        characteristic of English beer. Fuggle has suffered from wilts of late, and
        has largely been replaced by newer varieties. Fuggle provides a full British
        style palate and can be used alone, but is often blended with East Kent Goldings.
