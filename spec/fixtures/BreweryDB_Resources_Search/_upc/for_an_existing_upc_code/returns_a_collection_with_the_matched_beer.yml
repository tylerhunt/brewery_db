        Brown Ale","description":"This is the award-winning original American brown
        ale, first brewed as a holiday specialty, and now one of our most popular
        beers year-round. Northern English brown ales tend to be strong and dry, while
        southern English brown ales are milder and sweeter. Brooklyn Brown Ale combines
        the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form
        of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them
        roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor,
        fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background.
        Generous late hopping brings forward a nice hop aroma to complete the picture.
        Brooklyn Brown Ale is full-flavored but retains a smoothness and easy drinkability
        that has made it one of the most popular dark beers in the Northeast.","abv":"5.6","ibu":"30","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LVjHK1\/upload_yxlhuf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LVjHK1\/upload_yxlhuf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LVjHK1\/upload_yxlhuf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Brooklyn
        Brown Ale is particularly good with steaks, burgers, stews and barbecue, where
        it can put its caramel flavors to work with the caramelized flavors in the
        meat. It\u2019s also excellent with venison, ham and roasted pork, which engage
        the depth of malt character. Well-aged cheddar and sheep\u2019s milk cheese
        will pair up nicely.","originalGravity":"1.063","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:54","updateDate":"2013-08-13

        low to medium hop flavor and aroma, medium to high hop bitterness, and a medium
        body. Estery and fruity-ester characters should be subdued. Diacetyl should
        not be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"45","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"6.4","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"26","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.01","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21
