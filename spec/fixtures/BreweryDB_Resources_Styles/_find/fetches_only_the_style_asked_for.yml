        and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character. Note that \"earthy,
        herbal English-variety hop character\" is the perceived end, but may be a
        result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Medium to high
        hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale
        ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable.
        Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be
        in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable,
        though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic
        when at very low levels.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"5","ogMin":"1.04","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21
