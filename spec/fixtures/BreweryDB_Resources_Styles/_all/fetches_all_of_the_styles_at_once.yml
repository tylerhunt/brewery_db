        Quadrupel","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the
        immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas. Its
        color is deep amber to rich chestnut\/garnet brown. Often characterized by
        a mousse-like dense, sometimes amber head will top off a properly poured and
        served quad. Complex fruity aroma and flavor emerge reminiscent of raisins,
        dates, figs, grapes, plums often accompanied with a hint of winy character.
        Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, not
        cloying, while complementing fruitiness. Though well attenuated it usually
        has a full, creamy body. Hop characters do not dominate; low to low-medium
        bitterness is perceived. Perception of alcohol can be extreme. Clove-like
        phenolic flavor and aroma should not be evident. Chill haze is acceptable
        at low serving temperatures. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived. Well

        commemorate combinations of ingredients and\/or techniques adopted by or unique
        to a particular region. At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or
        techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques
        commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and
        popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients
        and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other
        styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based
        beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate,
        etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and
        beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines.
        They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have
        characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions,
        carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally
        associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include
        current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are
        not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti,
        S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples
        might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients
        and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of
        location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories.
        Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other
        ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would
        be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative
        beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients
        would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper
        evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges
        with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating
        the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as
        well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients,
        process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison
        between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement
        of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer
        without revealing the company''s identity. This statement should be carefully
        crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their
        decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise
