        1985, while attending the University of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs
        wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh, on \u201caqueous beer foam\u201d (the
        head of a beer). It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest
        itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9\/11 while he
        drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings
        and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion
        to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends
        Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity
        fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey
        decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d
        in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s
        family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies
        perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and
        art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room.
        Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and
        Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces
        Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat,
        as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes
        beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware
        and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be
        purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and
        liquor stores.","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-25
