        Beer began during the dark days of the July 2006 siege on Lebanon. Tired with
        the lack of quality beer in Lebanon, Mazen Hajjar and his friends started
        to brew beer in his very own kitchen. The first batches were brewed in 20
        liter kettles. Granted that war and blockades are not the ideal conditions
        to start a company, alongside everyone telling them they were mad to even
        consider it, they went ahead with it anyway. They decided that brewing a good
        beer for a great country was what they wanted to do the most.\r\n\r\nWhen
        961 Beer officially began brewing they were one of the smallest breweries
        in the world, and the only microbrewery in the Middle East (and still are).

        of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway
        and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River. \r\n\r\nMBBC
        was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn
        the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education
        in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique
        and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations
        to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter,
        award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked
        porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe
        brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee
        Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers
        and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911
        as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts
        from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space
        with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort.
        \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs
        of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers
        can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events
        or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please
        check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_ywwMfl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_ywwMfl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_ywwMfl-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03

        Brewing Company","description":"In late 2005, Nikos Ridge and Jamie Floyd
        met at a favorite local bottle\r\nshop in Eugene, Ore. Nikos was sampling
        a beer Jamie had brewed at a local\r\nrestaurant\/brewery and through mutual
        friends, the two started talking.\r\nThe conversation landed on the question,
        \u201cWhat would you do if you could\r\nopen your own brewery?\u201d With
        Nikos\u2019 background in finance and Jamie\u2019s\r\nexperience in brewing,
        it seemed like a good skillset for starting a brewery.\r\nThe two began brewing
        about six months later, on June 15, 2006, when\r\nNikos and Jamie spent 17
        hours brewing the first batch of Total Domination\r\nIPA. The first kegs were
        produced in a leased space inside of a German\r\nrestaurant in Springfield,
        Ore. Once a brewery, the building was equipped\r\nwith a 15-barrel brew house.
        Here, a new craft brewery was born with one\r\nsoul driving purpose\u2014through
        the creation of the highest quality beers;\r\nto improve the lives of its
        customers, the residents of its communities, its\r\nemployees, and business
        partners.\r\n\r\nBoth founders knew they wanted to do things differently\u2014within
        the beer\r\nindustry and in the local community. In a time when the industry
        landscape\r\nwas home to male-centric brands, Nikos and Jamie strived for
        a company\r\nthat represented what beer meant to them\u2014a source of community
        and\r\nthe root of human existence. And so, Ninkasi\u2014the Sumerian goddess
        of\r\nfermentation\u2014was selected as the name. Throughout human history,
        beer\r\nnot only was a catalyst for written language and organized education,
        but\r\nwas also the center of community and culture, one never in operation\r\nwithout
        the other\u2014a driving force behind the new brewery. In a quest to\r\nfind
        property that could cultivate community spirit, the two purchased real\r\nestate
        in Eugene\u2019s Whiteaker neighborhood and moved the brewery to its\r\ncurrent
        location in 2007.\r\nSince then, Ninkasi has undergone three expansions, to
        produce more\r\nbeer for more people. The expansions included a larger production
        facility,\r\ntasting room, office spaces, and local distribution, all while
        keeping the\r\nfocus on brewing excellent craft beer. Ninkasi\u2019s culture
        continues to embody\r\n\u201cBelieve in the Goddess\u201d\u2014symbolizing
        the Ninkasi ideal in an elevated\r\nhuman experience through the social enjoyment
        and sharing of beer.\r\nThe current brewery features a 55-barrel brewing system,
        with a capacity of\r\n95,000 barrels per year of craft beer to be distributed
        throughout Alaska,\r\nCalifornia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and
        British Columbia.\r\nThe Ninkasi family of beers, known as its Flagship Series,
        has grown from\r\nits first batch of Total Domination IPA to include Tricerahops
        Double IPA,\r\nBeliever Double Red, Oatis Oatmeal Stout, Vanilla Oatis Oatmeal
        Stout,\r\nand Quantum Pale Ale. Today, the Ninkasi family of brands includes
        its\r\nFlagship, Seasonal Release, Special Release, Prismatic Lager, Single

        Lakes Brewing Company","description":"In 1985, while attending the University
        of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh,
        on \u201caqueous beer foam\u201d (the head of a beer). It would take 21 years
        for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The
        spark would come after 9\/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of
        his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating
        a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company.
        Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche
        developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to
        create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery
        at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This
        historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations
        and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing.
        Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate
        a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13,
        2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were
        launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern
        Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal
        styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available
        on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania.
        Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs
        are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
