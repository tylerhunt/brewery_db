        Beer began during the dark days of the July 2006 siege on Lebanon. Tired with
        the lack of quality beer in Lebanon, Mazen Hajjar and his friends started
        to brew beer in his very own kitchen. The first batches were brewed in 20
        liter kettles. Granted that war and blockades are not the ideal conditions
        to start a company, alongside everyone telling them they were mad to even
        consider it, they went ahead with it anyway. They decided that brewing a good
        beer for a great country was what they wanted to do the most.\r\n\r\nWhen
        961 Beer officially began brewing they were one of the smallest breweries
        in the world, and the only microbrewery in the Middle East (and still are).
        Although 961 Beer now brews nearly 2 million liters per year, they still insist
        upon making beer using the very same principles: traditional techniques, quality
        ingredients and love.","website":"http:\/\/www.961beer.com","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SIlrQa\/upload_N7AHMN-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SIlrQa\/upload_N7AHMN-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/SIlrQa\/upload_N7AHMN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-08

        Lakes Brewing Company","description":"In 1985, while attending the University
        of California at Berkeley, Samuel Hobbs wrote a chemistry paper, for a laugh,
        on \u201caqueous beer foam\u201d (the head of a beer). It would take 21 years
        for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The
        spark would come after 9\/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of
        his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating
        a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company.
        Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche
        developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to
        create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery
        at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This
        historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations
        and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing.
        Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate
        a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13,
        2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were
        launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern
        Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal
        styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available
        on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania.
        Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs
        are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_AT5fnN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
