        Ales","description":"Rogue Ales was founded in 1988 by Jack Joyce, Rob Strasser
        and Bob Woodell, three corporate types who wanted to go into the food\/beverage
        industry. Rogue''s first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a
        10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May
        1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997,
        after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named
        Howard after John Maier''s former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred
        across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998
        Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in
        use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery
        tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and
        check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead
        if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer''s on the
        Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina
        (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles (inside).","website":"http:\/\/www.rogue.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X0l98q\/upload_LXdf6X-icon.png","medium":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X0l98q\/upload_LXdf6X-medium.png","large":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X0l98q\/upload_LXdf6X-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
