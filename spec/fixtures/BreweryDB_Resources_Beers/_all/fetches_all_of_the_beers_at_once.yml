        would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters
        of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor
        or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities.
        For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn,

        competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the
        beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair
        assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty

        for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in

        wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional
        style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time
        in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention
        of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has
        previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as
        a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood
        aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry,
        rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting
        complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and
        mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel
        flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.
        Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or
        wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition
        managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol
        and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for
        fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting
        brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties)
        and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
        The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer

        meaning yeast is not added. Once the beer is brewed, it is transferred to
        a cool-ship or \u201chorny\u201d tank located in our barrel room at the pub.
        There it sits overnight and collects whatever funky wild yeast and bacteria

        wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional
        style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time
        in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention
        of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has
        previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as
        a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood
        aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry,
        rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting
        complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and
        mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel
        flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.
        Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or
        wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition
        managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol
        and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for
        fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting
        brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties)
        and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process.
        The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer
        style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"}},{"id":"gum7TK","name":"Belgian

        M\u00fcnchner Dunkel","description":"These light brown to dark brown beers
        have a pronounced malty aroma and flavor that dominates over the clean, crisp,
        moderate hop bitterness. This beer does not offer an overly sweet impression,
        but rather a mild balance between malt sweetness, hop bitterness and light
        to moderate mouthfeel. A classic M\u00fcnchner Dunkel should have chocolate-like,
        roast malt, bread-like or biscuit-like aroma that comes from the use of Munich
        dark malt. Chocolate or roast malts can be used, but the percentage used should
        be minimal. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible.
        Diacetyl should not be perceived. Ale-like fruity esters and chill haze should
        not be perceived.","ibuMin":"16","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21

        isn\u2019t just for breakfast! Dark rich malts blend with smooth oats to produce
        a jazzy brew with notes of coffee and chocolate. Having desert, why not add
        some decadence and pair it with this beer.","abv":"5.5","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-06-04

        stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor
        and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy. A roasted malt character
        which is caramel-like and chocolate-like should be evident - smooth and not
        bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and roasted malt aromas (chocolate and
        nut-like) are prominent. Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate,
        not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall
        balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity
        esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity
        range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21
