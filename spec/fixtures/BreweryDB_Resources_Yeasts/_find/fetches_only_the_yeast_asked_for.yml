        when brewing American styles of beer, this strain?s performance is consistent
        and it makes great beer. This versatile strain is a very good choice for a
        ?House? strain. Expect a soft, clean profile with hints of nut, and a slightly
        tart finish. Ferment at warmer temperatures to accentuate hop character with
        an increased fruitiness. Or, ferment cool for a clean, light citrus character.
        It attenuates well and is reliably flocculent, producing bright beer without
        filtration.","yeastType":"ale","attenuationMin":72,"attenuationMax":76,"fermentTempMin":60,"fermentTempMax":72,"alcoholToleranceMin":10,"alcoholToleranceMax":10,"productId":"1272","supplier":"Wyeast","yeastFormat":"liquid","category":"yeast","categoryDisplay":"Yeast","createDate":"2013-06-24
