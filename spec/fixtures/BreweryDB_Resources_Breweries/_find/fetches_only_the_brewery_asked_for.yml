        Brewing Company","description":"Founders Brewing Company, founded by Mike
        Stevens and Dave Engbers produced its first beer in November of 1997. Built
        out of a dream and a passion for home brewing, what started out as a hobby
        quickly became a thriving business.  As the years have passed, Founders has
        built its brewery on the exploration of recipe development and brewing techniques.
        We are not the standard micro-brewery, rather we have traveled a path that
        breaks from the standard craft-brewer.\r\n\r\nCarving a niche out of the craft
        industry, Founders Brewing Company has built its reputation on producing very
        unique beers. Our focus is to offer our wholesalers, retailers and consumers
        a product that stands alone on the shelf and offers a true drinking experience
        to our friends, the consumer.  As the years have passed, Founders has built
